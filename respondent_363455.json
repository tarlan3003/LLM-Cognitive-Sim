      "full_question_text": "[FIRST DRAFT] 2024 Time Series Pre-Election Questionnaire November 6, 2024 This draft questionnaire is being provided so that the ANES user community is informed as to the questions that appeared in the pre-election survey for the ANES 2024 Time Series study. Please note that the draft questionnaire is a preliminary version and lacks some of the quality control and documentation that will benefit future versions of the questionnaire. When reviewing the questionnaire, please keep in mind that: The questionnaire focus is on the interviewer-administered version of the questionnaire. However, questions were modified as necessary to accommodate other modes such as online interviewing. An example of such a modification would be removing references to participant/respondent booklets. Except for the CASI (Computer-Assisted Self-Interview) section and some open-ended items, interviewers in the interviewer- administered mode could accept “don’t know” answers from respondents. When the interviewer-administered interview was conducted by phone rather than in person, the CASI section was also administered directly by the interviewer with all questions read aloud and all answers also provided aloud directly from the respondent to the interviewer. The draft questionnaire provides section and item names to uniquely identify the questions that were asked in the pre-election study, but the variable names that will appear in the dataset when the data are eventually released will be named differently. Unless the label for a question indicates otherwise, the question was asked in all survey modes (web, phone, and in person). We hope you find this draft questionnaire to be useful. We would appreciate being notified of any errors by email to: anes@electionstudies.org Thank you!",
