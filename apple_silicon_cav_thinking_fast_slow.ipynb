    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've implemented Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) to replicate cognitive theories from Daniel Kahneman's \"Thinking Fast and Slow\". We've demonstrated how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a CAV implementation for manipulating model behavior\n",
    "2. Train CAVs for System 1 and System 2 thinking patterns\n",
    "3. Train CAVs for specific cognitive biases from the book\n",
    "4. Test the CAVs on examples from \"Thinking Fast and Slow\"\n",
    "5. Create a comprehensive test set for evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Apple Silicon Compatibility Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has been specifically optimized for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Macs by:\n",
    "- Completely disabling MPS device usage to avoid compatibility issues\n",
    "- Using mean pooling for activation processing to avoid dimension mismatch errors\n",
    "- Adding explicit device management for tensors\n",
    "- Including comprehensive error handling and debugging information\n",
    "- Reducing the number of examples for faster testing\n",
    "- Adding dimension compatibility checks in the steering hooks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To further extend this work, you could:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train CAVs for additional cognitive biases from the book\n",
    "2. Experiment with different layer selections for different biases\n",
    "3. Develop more sophisticated evaluation metrics\n",
    "4. Combine multiple biases to create more complex cognitive patterns\n",
    "5. Compare CAV-based steering with other approaches like fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation provides a foundation for using CAVs to replicate and study cognitive biases in language models, offering insights into both human cognition and AI behavior."
